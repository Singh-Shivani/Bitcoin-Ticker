This is a crypto currency price checking app. Here you can check prices in three different crypto currencies namely - BTC, ETH, LTC.ðŸ¤‘

Here we are fetching the live data from the CryptoCompare -  https://www.cryptocompare.com/.
The CryptoCompare is so far very easy to use and integrate in projects, and gives accurate price rates too.

Here's a simple URL given by CryptoCompare to fetch the prices in crypto currency BTC, also you can fetch prices for other two crypto currencies in the same manner, just by changing the name from BTC to required crypto currency.

https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD,GBP,EUR

Then you get data in JSON format.
 
Because CryptoCompare is freeðŸ’° to use(limited features only!), it gives you free API key to integrate in your work projects (and you saved some moneyðŸ˜‰).
